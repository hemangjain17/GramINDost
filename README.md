# Smart Farm Project

Welcome to the **Smart Farm Project**! This project uses technology to help farmers grow crops more effectively. It focuses on two main areas: **Crop Prediction** and **Health Monitoring**.

## Introduction

The Smart Farm Project aims to make farming smarter by using data and technology. We use machine learning and sensors to help farmers make better decisions and increase their crop yields.

## Features

- **Crop Prediction**: Helps farmers choose the best crops based on data.
- **Health Monitoring**: Uses sensors to track soil and plant health.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use dashboard for farmers.
- **Data Analytics**: Provides insights into crop performance.

## Crop Prediction

The **Crop Prediction** feature uses data to suggest which crops to plant. It looks at:

- **Soil Quality**: Nutrient levels and moisture.
- **Climate Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
- **Historical Data**: Past crop performance.

## Health Monitoring

The **Health Monitoring** system uses sensors to keep track of plant and soil health:

- **Soil Moisture Sensors**: Check soil moisture levels.
- **Nutrient Monitoring**: Ensure soil has enough nutrients.
- **Environmental Sensors**: Monitor temperature and humidity.
